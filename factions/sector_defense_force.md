# Sector Defense Force

**Theme:** Industrial, militaristic, disciplined. The backbone of the Imperium.
**Inspiration:** Imperial Guard / Astra Militarum.

## Unique Mechanics

### Chain of Command
*   **Officer Units:** Players primarily issue orders to Officers (Commissars, Lieutenants).
*   **Command Radius:** Officers relay orders to units within their radius.
*   **Command Delay:** Units outside of command radius suffer from significant order delays or revert to basic tactical AI (e.g., Hold Ground, Return Fire).
*   **Strategy:** You must protect your officers to maintain the cohesion of your massive armies.
