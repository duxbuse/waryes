# Iron Vanguard

**Theme:** Elite, low model count, shock assault.
**Inspiration:** Vanguard Troopers / Astartes.

## Unique Mechanics

### Autonomous Elite
*   **No Command Delay:** Units are highly disciplined and autonomous. They do not suffer from command delays like the SDF.
*   **Brotherhood:** Units gain passive buffs when fighting in close proximity to other squad types to encourage combined arms (e.g., Tactical squads gain accuracy near Devastators).
*   **And They Shall Know No Fear:** Immune to suppression shocks that would break lesser units. They fight at full efficiency until death (or critical suppression).
